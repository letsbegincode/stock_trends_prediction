The next-generation iPhone is expected to be Apple\\u2019s first 5G-capable device and could lead to a so-called \\u201csuper cycle,\\u201d during which the company would see a larger than normal uptick in iPhone sales.\\n\\nThe idea is that consumers who have held on to their devices for several years will jump at the chance to get a new iPhone with a new form of cellular connectivity that promises dramatically increased data.\\n\\nBut with consumer personal consumption spending in Q2 [falling a whopping 34.6%](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q2-gdp-us-economy-coronavirus-pandemic-consumer-171558880.html) due to COVID-19 shutdowns, and more than [50 million Americans out of the workforce](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobless-claims-week-ending-july-25-123150219.html), investor hopes of a massive uptick in year-over-year iPhone sales in the coming quarters may not be in the cards.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html)\",\n          \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nI\\u2019m an experienced RT who sees patients and also in medical sales. Vents, Oxygen, cpaps, bipaps etc is my wheelhouse. I have many accounts all over. Stating the obvious here.. it\\u2019s been chaos.\\n\\nGoes without saying, it\\u2019s getting worse. I\\u2019m seeing it first hand. Shortage of RT\\u2019s to work the vents is the rising issue. I got 6 job offers yesterday without even looking for a job. Offers of 250,000 from recruiters which is 3x the normal RT salary in the hospital. I got a mass email from our governor begging to help in a big hospital. \\n\\nThe point of all this is I\\u2019ve never been more confident in making such a bold statement. We will not be \\u201copen\\u201d for Easter and if we do it\\u2019s going to have detrimental repercussions. \\n\\nThe question: if I think the timeframe of progress is going to be a lot longer (after summer) than trumps April, what individual stocks will bleed the worst? What companies are hanging on by a thread until mid April and get crushed if no progress is made by q3. Looking for PUT options. I already have SPY but I\\u2019m looking for stocks that would go down at a higher percentage than SPY. \\n\\nExample: Apple would lose a couple points if the market continues to slide but not as much as maybe six flags would.
